### Specifications

Make a simple Rails application for accepting new user signups. No need to worry about
handling logins and sessions. We just want a form, which users can complete to create an
account.
The form should allow each user to provide the following information:
● Username (required)
● Password (required)
● Email address (required)
● Address
● Telephone number
Once submitted, the user’s details should be saved to a database.
After the user’s account has been created, send them an email welcoming them to the platform
and confirming their username.
